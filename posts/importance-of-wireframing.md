#### What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the skeletal framework of which your design is built around. Imagine your design as your body and your wireframe as your skeleton or your design as a house you want to build and your wireframe as it’s blueprint. It’s that simple.

It is the basic outline of elements and features of your design made by freehand sketches and by the use of digital tools.

##### Why are wireframes important in the design process?

• It gives you a clearer visual of what you need in your design. It helps you decide where and how to place your page elements.

• It creates room to explore ideas and experiment as much as you need to.

• It ensures clarity in communication between you and your clients.

Now that you know the basics of wireframing, how do you know what to do and what not to? Let’s find out.

##### Things to Do

1.  Conduct your research before you start mapping out your ideas.
    
2.  Be free to develop as many ideas as you think is possible.
    
3.  Keep your wireframes simple: they are just outlines.
    
4.  Make sure your wireframes are clear and understandable.
    
5.  Involve people. Your friends, coworkers, even clients are most likely the users. Mind mapping with people would definitely be to your advantage.
    

#### What to avoid

1.  Don’t show too much details. Wireframing should be plain outlines of your ideas. You don’t need to include the content of your design.
    
2.  Avoid starting with a digital tool. It’s best to start by sketching your ideas whenever they come in.
    
3.  Your wireframe shouldn’t include color, images nor logo. Working with a grayscale wireframe helps maintain focus. Only include color for highlights.
    
4.  Make sure to try different options. When you choose a solid layout you want to build your design on, then proceed to making the digital wireframe.
    

Wireframing is one essential skill every designer ought to know. For beginners, it’s important to learn and perfect this skill as you would need it in your design process.

Lastly, always remember to sketch out your ideas whenever they come to you!
