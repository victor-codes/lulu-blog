On most days, I pick my outfits based on my mood. This means that sometimes if you see me putting on black, I just might feel dark on the inside. The reason is I’ve gotten to understand and practice the concepts of colour usage to the extent where I use them in my personal life. 

A lot of people do things without reflecting on the impacts. It is said that somehow, everything you do — good or bad, leaves an impact on your life or personality. Everything, including design. As a designer, tracking your progress should not be just about improving your interface design. Having a solid understanding of design needs to be involved to create better experiences. 

Design thinking is human-centred. You have to understand the problems and needs of your users to provide standard and efficient solutions for them. When you repeatedly engage yourself in this process, it leaves an impact on you and you begin to practice this method in other parts of your life. As designers, we are influenced by design because it’s part of our role to think like our users.

I had a chat with a designer — [Emmanuel Adigwe](http://www.Twitter.com/EmmanuelCAdigwe), and he mentioned that one of the ways design has influenced his lifestyle is practising empathy. As designers, we should be able to see from other points of view and not make assumptions. Emma has also applied this in his interpersonal relationships. He tries to wear their lenses, to understand their problems, and find the best possible ways to solve them. This has also helped him become a better listener in decision making, conflicts, and other situations he encounters. 

Asides being empathetic, Emma has also become passionate about accessibility. Recall that as designers, our main role is problem-solving. Therefore, our solutions should be suitable for everyone. Design has helped him see disability from a different view. He has gotten to understand that disability is not necessarily a permanent situation. For instance, a person driving in heavy rainfall and finding it hard to see can be interpreted as being disabled for that moment. He worked on a prison support project with an NGO, while in the university. The team had interpretations – which were drawn from assumptions of what the prisoners would need. They introduced craftsmanship to them yet they didn’t get a positive response rate. Emma believes if he knew then, what he knows and has learnt now from design, they would have taken a better approach in creating a solution that would work.

Design makes us understand that to make solutions for people, you have to understand them. Test the solutions with them, get feedback and work with the feedback you’ve gotten to get better results. This means your whole design process can be implemented in your lifestyle and daily activities. 

After having a chat with another friend – [Charles Njoku](http://www.Twitter.com/madebycharles), I realized that design also makes us understand other beliefs. Charles explained that as a designer, he has learnt to understand that situations and experiences make people and forms the foundation of their characters, habits, and beliefs. So, when creating a solution for these people, the characters and beliefs are important case studies to ensure your solution is suitable for them. In design thinking, this is the second phase, the Define phase, of the process. 

Your progress as a designer would mostly reflect in your personal life. Apart from improving on user interfaces, to be a better designer, you have to improve your design thinking.
