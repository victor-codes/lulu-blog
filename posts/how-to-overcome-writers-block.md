Writing is one of the most creative things to do and all authors and even individuals in other fields of creative work, experience that period when they’re not exactly being productive.

Writer’s block is a condition in which an author experiences a slowdown or inability to be creative or produce new work.

Some authors have been made to believe that writer’s block is caused by lack of skill and commitment. This belief only leaves a bad result on your confidence and esteem, as it is not true.

There are so many known causes of writer’s block. Here’s a few,

**1. Lack of inspiration**

Many a times, writers need to be inspired to be productive. Finding your inspiration as a writer, is important. You could be inspired by people, videos, songs, podcasts, money, the Bible, the Quran, tweets, Pinterest and even random pages you search on google.

From experience, when you lack inspiration, it feels like you’re in an empty room or lost and trying to be found. It’s best to find what inspires you at the start of your career as a writer.

**2. Self doubt**

It’s completely normal to experience self doubt sometimes. Every creative goes through this. However, when it becomes regular, it turns a problem.

Impostor’s syndrome is a psychological problem that makes a person feel incompetent and inadequate, despite all proof that he is skilled or accomplished. This creates a fear of being seen as a fraud in your field of work.

If allowed to grow, impostor’s syndrome reduces your level of productivity as writer, till you completely stop writing.

**3. Fear**

Fear is one of major causes of self doubt which leads to writer’s block. Most times, we are afraid of putting our work out because they don’t seem so good to us. We are afraid of being backlashed as a bad writer by readers and even other writers.

Fear, when entertained, causes writers to lose confidence in their work and even themselves.

**4. Pressure**

Take it easy. Pressure from work, friends and life entirely could be tiring. Nonetheless, we shouldn’t allow this stop us from doing what we do. Pressure most times leads to both physical and mental stress, which could cause a writer to retire completely.

**5. Criticism**

Criticism is known to mess with the self esteem and confidence of a person, a lot of times. When criticism is badly delivered, it causes a feeling of hurt and reduces how you feel about what was criticized. Still, you have to learn to accept constructive criticism and believe in yourself as no one is perfect. Also, remember that not everyone would like your work.

**How to overcome writer’s block**

Dealing with writer’s block, is not an easy thing to do. However, it can definitely be dealt with.

• To start with, find your inspiration. Get that person, thing or topic that inspires you to do better and write more. So, when the block happens, you know how to get inspired easily.

• When in self doubt, take a self assessment test. Ask yourself positive questions. What you’ve accomplished and how you accomplished them. This would help you realize your positive sides and rise back on your feet as a writer.

• Talk to someone when you’re feeling down. Sometimes, you need someone who can talk to you into motivation. I would definitely recommend you talk to a friend or loved one.

• When you feel pressured, take a break. Relax from what you can and take self care into action. In the process, you would definitely regain the strength to write.

• Believe in yourself and have confidence in your works.

• Never compare yourself to others. Doing so would only hurt your self esteem

• Learn to accept constructive criticism; Acknowledge that not everyone would like your work and wrongly delivered criticism should not change your views on your work.

• Remind yourself, constantly, of how amazing a writer you are.

Writer’s Block could take a short time or might even be for a long period of time. You should start working on it immediately you begin to experience it because the longer it takes, the deeper it gets.

Always believe in yourself and remember that you a great writer.
