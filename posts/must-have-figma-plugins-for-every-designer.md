Plugins are third-party scripts that add to the functionality of an application. They’re just like the applications on your phone. You have to install to use them in your design tool. Plugins are the one of the best things that happened to figma. With plugins, designing is smoother and even seamless.

When I started designing, I had no idea what plugins were. Designing felt so stressful and was mentally tiring. A lot of design beginners don’t know about plugins and how useful they are.

There are plugins that every designer should have. These plugins add to the functionality of your design and make work easier for you.

Here’s a list of them

**1. Iconify**

This plugin is known to have 5000+ icons and emojis. Iconify imports these icons in svg format to your design without having to go to the website, giving full edit access to its user.

**2. Unsplash**

Unsplash is a website that provides high-resolution free images. Using the plugin saves you the stress of going to the website to download those images. They give free access to the public usage of these images as long as you don't claim ownership to them.
