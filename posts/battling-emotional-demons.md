  Christians often say that battles are for the Lord to fight. However, the
  Bible also says “If any would not work, neither should he eat”, which simply
  means Heaven helps those who help themselves.

  Every person gets to fight some kind of demon. In movies and myths, they often represent demons as ugly looking creatures, with the aim to cause affliction and pain on its target and whoever gets in its way.

Christians often say that battles are for the Lord to fight. However, the Bible also says “If any would not work, neither should he eat”, which simply means Heaven helps those who help themselves.

Every person gets to fight some kind of demon. In movies and myths, they often represent demons as ugly looking creatures, with the aim to cause affliction and pain on its target and whoever gets in its way.

Abstract feelings can also be demons. Not all demons come in ugly forms. The movies also sometimes, represents them as shapeshifters. Identifying and slaying these demons become harder, because the target, in most cases, have connections with their other forms.

Relating these demons to our everyday lives — At some point, life comes at us in terrible ways that have us fighting hard for our freedom. It gets even worse when we realize we have no strength in us to fight.

We see many cases of sudden deaths and suicide because they believe to have suffered enough. They feel there is no more strength left. Sadly, they might not have realized that the strength comes from within.

Finding your inner strength is not easy. We’re often left with the impression that we can make things easy for ourselves. Fortunately, that’s not a belief I succumb to. You don’t make things easier. You only become familiar with the struggle and the steps to overcome them.

To channel your inner strength to fight and find peace after battle, here are a few things I do that you can try;

-   **Cry**

For me, crying has become very therapeutic. You know, sometimes, when you fall down, you stand up and laugh about it and keep going. That’s how it is when I cry. After crying, I laugh and remind myself that it’s going to be okay and the ko most questionable part is how I get right back to work almost immediately, like nothing happened.

-   **Take a break**

From emotional stress, of course! Nobody enjoys being stressed. So, when these hard times come, take a break from every and any-thing that stresses you mentally.

-   **Keep a journal**

Writing my feelings helps me understand them. I also get the clarity I need in the midst of journaling which I believe to be a very therapeutic exercise to improve one’s life. It helps you be more intentional about becoming a better person.

-   **Therapy**

This might not be effective for everyone, but it is worth trying. Talking to someone, in most cases, helps you feel better and a talking to a professional makes experience even better. Talking to someone helps you identify these demons, how they’re attacking and why you’re a target.

-   **Mindfulness**

You have to Focus on the present. Meditation, short breaks, yoga, sports are friendly approaches to practicing mindfulness. Being mindful helps reduce stress, gain awareness and insights on our minds by observation, improves your performance and makes us pay attention to other parts of our well-being.

-   **Love**

> Overcome the demons with a thing called love.” — Bob Marley

Experiencing love is such a beautiful feeling. It’s so much prettier when it’s from yourself. The level of confidence you get to reach and how much care you show yourself because of love. Find love, in yourself and see how much it improves your general routine and well-being.

Emotional strength helps us break free from our emotional demons. In channeling your inner strength, you find coping strategies that work for you.

Coping strategies shouldn’t be inflicting pain on yourself. Letting that happen means assisting the demon we are fighting. One of the best coping strategies I have practiced is letting go of negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. You also have to set goals and form habits to reach these goals. Reducing stress, workload, resting, exercise, good sleeping and eating habits are very efficient coping mechanisms.

Are you fighting some kind of demon? I’ll leave you with a note from a fellow fighter;

_Dear friend,_

_I know that no one really understands what you’re going through. Nobody really gets what you’re feeling and how badly it hurts. You may not want to tell anybody because you cannot put into words what it is you feel but hey! I want you to help you feel better. I know, that it’s difficult, but you’re gonna get through it, no matter what it takes._
