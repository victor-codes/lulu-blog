# How to Stay Productive Working from Home

Due to the pandemonium, many companies –home and abroad, have resulted in working remotely. Managing this shift in how we collaborate and communicate while doing our work has been a challenge for employees.

Even workers with experience in working remote still face a lot of challenges. Many parents have to juggle taking care of their kids and family while working, and for first-timers, this means figuring out how to be productive and remain focused in this environment.

With all the many responsibilities and tasks at home, working while juggling these responsibilities and still finding time for yourself can be challenging, especially if it’s your first time. However, having some productivity tricks in your daily routines can help you complete your tasks efficiently without messing with your sanity.

### Tips to Increase Your Productivity at Home

- **Create a dedicated workspace**

One of the best ways to separate your work and home life is by setting up a workspace. Ideally, this should be separate from your bedroom, but it could also be in your room if there is not enough space for a home office.

- **Focus on your output**

Rather than focus on getting all your tasks done, focus on what the outcome of your tasks would mean. Productivity isn’t only about getting things done. It also involves doing them efficiently.

- **Prep the night before**

After the day’s work, sort out the to-do for the next day, starting with your uncompleted tasks. When you do this, you have a sense of direction on how your next day would be. Another kind of preparation you should engage in is mental preparation – Figuring out blockers and improvements.

- **Work with priorities**

What tasks need to be completed ASAP? Which can wait till tomorrow? You can make a to-do list and number items in order of importance. It will help you remain focused and committed to finishing your tasks for the day. However, you have to make sure they are realistic and achievable.

- **Automate tasks if you can**

These days, we have a lot of technology that allows you to automate tasks. For instance, as a business or social content creator, you schedule the content for your profiles using technologies like Buffer and Tailwind. You can also schedule emails in different mail clients like Gmail.

- **Avoid distractions**

If you have distractions such as your phone and social media around you, you tend to divert focus meant for getting tasks done. Your level of productivity when you allow distractions can drop by over 40%.

Other tips you can use include avoiding multitasking, getting a to-do pad, taking breaks, and saving your energy.

### **My top productivity strategy**

My level of productivity used to be low and dependent on a lot of things. Over time, I started to find solutions and ways to increase my productivity. The first step I took was setting up my workspace in my room.

I got a table, an office chair and being a stationery person – a few stationery supplies. Then I started using my journal to create daily to-do lists and track how productive I was each day. Doing this every day helped me to look forward to being better the next day. I also broke tasks into smaller bits, and it helped me be more realistic with how much I could do in a day.

Another good trick that helped was my journaling. Every morning I sort out my daily activities – Highlighting my tasks and priorities, and taking notes when I needed to in my journal. I also began to do constant self-reviews each day to sort my finished and unfinished tasks.

By practising these tips and making them habits, you create a system that helps your productivity, not just for work but in your everyday life.
