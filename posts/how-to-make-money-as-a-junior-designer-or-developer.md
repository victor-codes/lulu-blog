One of the major struggles junior designers and developers tend to experience, is getting a job. Most of the time, it becomes a worry and makes you start question your abilities.

There are a lot of other skills that you could earn from while applying to land your dream job. These skills become useful in a wide range of cases in the future and even adds to work experience in your resume. Here are a few of them;

**1. Wordpress**

[Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) is a Content Management System (CMS) platform used to create different kinds of websites. Many companies use Wordpress for their websites, because it’s easy to manage.

Since Wordpress requires little or no code, as a designer or even a developer, you can use Wordpress to build websites, and get paid for it. You can even have extra monthly costs for maintenance; depending on preference.

**2. Webflow**

[Webflow](https://webflow.com/) is another platform that doesn't require code blocks in creating websites. In recent times, the demand for webflow has increased, as it has the power to provide the code as you make use of its drag and drop builder. This is another great skill you can use to make money, either as a designer or developer.

**3. Graphic Templates**

One of the most common ways to make these templates is [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) . With Canva, you can create social media posters, flyers, logos, presentations, card designs, highlight covers, and many more. Most of the time, small business owners employ people to create or personalize ready-made templates for them. If you have a good eye for design, you can also create premium templates for sale too.

Asides Canva, there are other apps like Adobe Spark and Over.

**4. Writing**

Writing is another amazing way to make money as a person in  tech. Asides from making money, it’s also a good way to learn and grow your audience. Sites like [SmashingMagazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) , [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) , [Twilio](https://go.twilio.com/) , [WPHub](https://www.wphub.com/write-for-us/) and more, pay individuals to write technical articles for them.

As a writer, you can share your articles on Hashnode, and earn from it using web monetization with [Coil](https://coil.com/) .
